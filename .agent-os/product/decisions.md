## 2025-01-04: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Cultural Consultant, Tech Lead, Artist Community

### Decision

ANAM Gallery will serve as a revolutionary digital platform for Korean calligraphy that bridges traditional Seoye art with contemporary digital experiences through an innovative "Zen Brutalism Foundation" design system, targeting art collectors, cultural institutions, students, and the global Korean art community with comprehensive cultural education and interactive experiences.

### Context

Korean calligraphy (Seoye) faces significant challenges in the digital age: lack of proper digital representation, risk of cultural knowledge loss due to modernization, scarcity of comprehensive educational resources, and limited global market visibility for Korean artists. The shift from Hanja to Hangul and rapid digitization creates urgency for preserving traditional calligraphic techniques and their philosophical foundations.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Commercial Art Marketplace Platform**
   - Pros: Clear revenue model, existing market demand, straightforward e-commerce implementation
   - Cons: Commodifies traditional art, lacks cultural depth, doesn't address educational needs, focuses on sales over preservation

2. **Pure Educational Platform**
   - Pros: Strong cultural preservation mission, clear educational value, potential institutional support
   - Cons: Limited revenue model, narrow audience, difficulty achieving sustainability, lacks collector engagement

3. **Traditional Museum Website Approach**
   - Pros: Established format, cultural authority, institutional credibility
   - Cons: Static experience, limited interactivity, poor mobile engagement, doesn't leverage modern technology

### Rationale

The hybrid approach combining cultural preservation, education, and commerce creates a sustainable platform that serves multiple stakeholder needs while maintaining cultural authenticity. The innovative Zen Brutalism Foundation design system differentiates us from generic art platforms while honoring traditional Korean aesthetic principles. The existing implementation with 58 artworks, multi-language support, and advanced interactive features demonstrates technical feasibility and market validation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Creates sustainable revenue model through multiple streams (education, e-commerce, partnerships)
- Preserves traditional Korean calligraphy knowledge for future generations
- Provides global access to authentic Korean cultural experiences
- Establishes new standard for digital cultural platform design
- Supports Korean artists with enhanced market visibility
- Builds bridges between traditional art and contemporary digital experiences

**Negative:**
- Complex platform requires significant ongoing cultural consultation and validation
- Higher development and maintenance costs due to cultural authenticity requirements  
- Need for continuous content creation and cultural context development
- Dependency on expert cultural advisors and artist community engagement
- Risk of cultural appropriation concerns if not properly managed

## 2025-01-04: Zen Brutalism Foundation Design System

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Design Lead, Cultural Consultant, UX Team

### Decision

Implement a three-phase "Zen Brutalism Foundation" design system that authentically combines traditional Korean aesthetic principles (여백의 미학 - void aesthetics, 음양균형 - yin-yang balance, 삼분법 - rule of thirds) with modern interactive design, featuring seasonal aesthetic changes, real-time mouse tracking, and progressive enhancement across three evolutionary phases.

### Context

Traditional art gallery websites use generic templates that fail to capture the spiritual essence and cultural depth of Korean calligraphy. Users need an immersive experience that honors the philosophical foundations of Seoye while providing modern digital interaction capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Standard Art Gallery Template**
   - Pros: Quick implementation, familiar user patterns, lower development cost
   - Cons: Lacks cultural authenticity, generic experience, doesn't differentiate from competitors

2. **Pure Traditional Korean Web Design**
   - Pros: High cultural authenticity, unique visual identity
   - Cons: May not translate well to modern web standards, potential accessibility issues, limited interactivity

### Rationale

The Zen Brutalism approach creates a unique digital experience that authentically represents Korean aesthetic principles while leveraging modern web capabilities. The three-phase evolution system allows progressive enhancement and provides multiple engagement levels for different user types.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Creates distinctive brand identity in the cultural platform space
- Provides authentic cultural experience that honors traditional principles
- Enables progressive user engagement through phase evolution
- Demonstrates technical innovation in cultural platform design

**Negative:**
- Higher complexity requires specialized design and development expertise
- Performance optimization challenges with complex interactive elements
- Need for ongoing cultural validation of design decisions

## 2025-01-04: Airtable CMS with PostgreSQL Migration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner, Content Team

### Decision

Start with Airtable as the primary CMS for rapid development and content management, with a planned migration to PostgreSQL as the platform scales beyond 500 artworks or 1000 monthly active users.

### Context

The platform needs to manage complex cultural content (58 artworks with rich metadata) while allowing non-technical team members to contribute cultural context and artwork information. The choice between rapid deployment and long-term scalability requires careful balance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **PostgreSQL from Start**
   - Pros: Better long-term scalability, full control over schema, better performance
   - Cons: Slower initial development, requires technical team for content management, higher initial infrastructure costs

2. **Headless CMS (Contentful/Strapi)**
   - Pros: Professional content management, good scalability, reasonable learning curve
   - Cons: Monthly costs, limited customization for cultural metadata, vendor dependency

### Rationale

Airtable allows rapid prototyping and validation while enabling cultural experts and artists to manage content directly. The planned migration strategy provides a clear path to scale while maintaining development velocity in the validation phase.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time-to-market for initial validation
- Non-technical team members can manage cultural content
- Lower initial infrastructure costs
- Clear scaling path with PostgreSQL migration

**Negative:**
- Technical debt from eventual migration requirements
- Potential performance limitations as content grows
- Dependency on third-party service for critical data
