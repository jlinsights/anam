## Overview

Implement a comprehensive cultural context database system that provides philosophical, historical, and technical context for each of the 58 Korean calligraphy artworks in the ANAM Gallery. This feature will transform the gallery from a simple viewing experience into an educational platform that preserves and teaches traditional Korean calligraphy culture to global audiences.

## User Stories

### Cultural Enthusiast Learning Journey

As a cultural enthusiast interested in Korean traditional arts, I want to access detailed philosophical and historical context for each calligraphy artwork, so that I can understand the deeper cultural significance, artistic techniques, and spiritual meanings behind each piece rather than just viewing the visual aesthetics.

The user clicks on any artwork and sees a rich contextual panel containing: historical period information, calligraphy school and lineage, philosophical background of the text content, brush technique analysis, cultural symbolism explanation, and connections to broader Korean cultural traditions. This educational context helps bridge the gap between traditional Korean culture and modern digital audiences.

### Art Educator Teaching Resource

As an art educator or cultural institution curator, I want to access structured educational materials for Korean calligraphy artworks, so that I can create lesson plans, exhibitions, and educational programs that accurately represent Korean cultural heritage with proper historical and philosophical depth.

The educator accesses comprehensive metadata including: categorized difficulty levels for different audiences, suggested learning progressions, related artworks for comparison studies, downloadable educational materials, and citation-ready cultural information that maintains academic standards while being accessible to learners.

### Artist and Student Research

As a practicing calligraphy artist or student, I want to study the technical aspects and cultural lineage of traditional works, so that I can understand proper techniques, cultural context, and artistic evolution while respecting traditional Korean calligraphy practices and philosophy.

The practitioner finds detailed technique analysis, information about the calligraphy master's lineage and school, philosophical foundations of the written content, seasonal and ceremonial contexts, and connections to other works in the same tradition, enabling deep cultural learning and authentic practice development.
